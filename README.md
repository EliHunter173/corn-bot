# Maze Solver

A maze solving algorithm implemented in Go.

This maze solver takes in JSON files describing a maze and outputs the solution to the maze as
JSON.

Included in this repo is a Python script that allows for the conversion of mazes drawn in ASCII
into the appropriate JSON for the maze for the maze solver.
